    "So what is the difference between linear regression and logistic regression? In linear regression problems, the target variable $y$ is a continuous value (e.g $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$). While in classification tasks, the output labels belong to a discrete set of values. (e.g $y \\in  \\{-1,1\\}$ in binary classification, or $y \\in \\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$ for multi-class classification with $k$ different classes). \n",
    "In logistic classification, the output label is also a function of the linear combination of input features. However, it needs to be scaled and interpreted as a probability of belonging to certain classes. Let us denote $p_n = P(y = 1)$ as the probability of the output $y$ equals to a class (e.g classify an email as spam/ham). Let's reuse the simple 1-D example from Linear Regression with some modifications to model the Logistic Regression function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_n = \\sigma(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma(.)$ is called a sigmoid function or a logistic function which serves the task of scaling the linear combination of input features to be in the range of 0 and 1 which matches the range of a probability value. The predicted class $\\hat{y}$ is 1 if $p_n >= 0.5$ and 0 if $p_n < 0.5$.\n",
    "The value of the logistic function is as the below graph. If $t > 0$ then the output of $\\sigma(t)$ is greater than 0.5, and it is less than 0.5 if $t < 0$. It outputs $1/2$ if $t = 0$. In other words, if the linear combination of input features is positive, then the predicted output is 1, otherwise the predicted output is 0. (This is related to the vector of the hyperplane that classifies the data. Interested readers can look at the references materials). Instead of using sigmoid function, we can also use $sign(.)$ function which outputs directly $1$ if the input is positive and $-1$ otherwise.\n",
